__Subject:__
##### Objectives:
```
Your objective is to make a small program which displays a 3D model created with a
modelisation software such as blender for example. The 3D model is stored inside a .obj
file. You should take care of a simple parsing to get the expected result.

In a window, your 3D object should be displayed, in perspective (that means that what is far
must be small), while rotating on itself around what seems to be its main rotation axis
(grossly the middle of the object...). With a color scheme, it should be possible to
distinguish the different triangles.
The model should be able to translate in the 3 axes, in the two directions.

Finally, a texture should be applied on the model when we press a dedicated key, the same
key must permit to come back to the default color display.
```
##### Constraints:
```
The technical constraints are as follow:
• Code to the norm and in C : The OpenGL API is in C, get used to it. Some languages overlay
  do a lot of things automatically, it would be too easy.
• Have a Makefile.
• Use a modern OpenGL : version 4.0 and above, with shaders.
• Only use external libraries (except OpenGL, libm and lib C) ONLY for the window and events
  handling. You can use your libft. In doubt, use the Minilibx with its OpenGL extension. No
  libraries to load the 3D model, or for matrices or shaders loading.
