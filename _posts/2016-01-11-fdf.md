_This project consist of creating a wireframe schematic graphical representation of a terrain in relief by linking different points (x, y, z) with segments._

__Subject:__
###### Objectives:
> In this project you will discover the basics of graphic programming, and in particular how
> to place points in space, how to join them with segments and most importantly how to
> observe the scene from a particular viewpoint.

> You will also discover your first graphic library: miniLibX. This library was developed
> internally and includes the minimum necessary to open a window, light a pixel and deal
> with events linked to this window: keyboard, mouse and “expose”. This project introduces
> you to “events” programming.

###### Constraints:
> Within your mandatory part, you are allowed to use the following functions:
> - open
> - read
> - write
> - close
> - malloc
> - free
> - perror
> - strerror
> - exit
> - All the functions defined in the library math (-lm et man 3 math)
> - All the functions defined in the library miniLibX.

__Installation:__

* `git clone https://github.com/wwatkins42/42_C_Projects.git`
* `cd ./42_C_Projects/Fdf`
* `make`
* `./fdf [map file_path]`

**Usage:**
* `./fdf [map file_path] [-p file_path] [-w width] [-h height] [--help]`

**Options:**
* `-p` [`file_path`] loads with a defined color palette.
* `-w` [`window_width`] loads with defined window width.
* `-h` [`window_height`]  loads with defined window height.
* `--help`  display help text.

**Example:**
* `./fdf maps/pylone.fdf -p palette/palette.fdfcolor -w 1500 -h 1200`

**Keys:**
* &#8593; &#8592; &#8595; &#8594;: move around
* `+` `-`: zoom
* `m`: change draw method
* `p`: change color (only if multiple color are in loaded palette, if loaded)
* `i` `k`: change maximum terrain elevation
* &#8670; &#8671;: change color elevation
