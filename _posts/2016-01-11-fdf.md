##### Introduction:
```
The representation in 3D of a landscape is a critical aspect of modern mapping. For
example, in these times of spatial exploration, to have a 3D representation of Mars is a
prerequisite condition to its conquest. As another example, comparing various 3D
representations of an area of high tectonic activity will allow you to better understand
these phenomenon and their evolution, and as a result be better prepared.

It’s your turn today to modelize in 3D some magnificent landscapes, imaginary or not...
```
##### Objectives:
```
In this project you will discover the basics of graphic programming, and in particular how
to place points in space, how to join them with segments and most importantly how to
observe the scene from a particular viewpoint.

You will also discover your first graphic library: miniLibX. This library was developed
internally and includes the minimum necessary to open a window, light a pixel and deal
with events linked to this window: keyboard, mouse and “expose”. This project introduces
you to “events” programming.
```

##### Constraints:
```
Within your mandatory part, you are allowed to use the following functions:
◦ open
◦ read
◦ write
◦ close
◦ malloc
◦ free
◦ perror
◦ strerror
◦ exit
◦ All the functions defined in the library math (-lm et man 3 math)
◦ All the functions defined in the library miniLibX.

__Installation:__

* `git clone https://github.com/wwatkins42/42_C_Projects.git`
* `cd ./42_C_Projects/Fdf`
* `make`
* `./fdf [map file_path]`

**Usage:**
* `./fdf [map file_path] [-p file_path] [-w width] [-h height] [--help]`

**Options:**
* `-p` [`file_path`] loads with a defined color palette.
* `-w` [`window_width`] loads with defined window width.
* `-h` [`window_height`]  loads with defined window height.
* `--help`  display help text.

**Example:**
* `./fdf maps/pylone.fdf -p palette/palette.fdfcolor -w 1500 -h 1200`

**Keys:**
* &#8593; &#8592; &#8595; &#8594;: move around
* `+` `-`: zoom
* `m`: change draw method
* `p`: change color (only if multiple color are in loaded palette, if loaded)
* `i` `k`: change maximum terrain elevation
* &#8670; &#8671;: change color elevation
