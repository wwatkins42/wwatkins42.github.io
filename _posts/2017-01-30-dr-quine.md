##### Introduction:
```
A quine is a non-empty computer program which takes no input and produces a copy of
its own source code as its only output.
The standard terms for these programs in the computability theory and computer science
literature are "self-replicating programs", "self-reproducing programs",
and "self-copying programs".

The operation which consists to open the code source and to display it is considered
cheating. More generally, a program which uses whatever data input cannot be
considered a valid quine. A trivial solution is a program for which the source code
is empty.
```
##### Objectives:
```
This project invites you to be confronted to the concept of auto-replicating programs and
the problematics associated with it. It's a perfect introduction to more complex projects,
such as malware projects.

For this project you will have to code three different programs, each having different
properties.
```
```
The first program will have the following properties :

• The executable is named Colleen.
• During its execution, the program must display on the standard output the same output
  as the source code used to compile this program.
• The source code must contain at least :
  ◦ A main function.
  ◦ Two different comments.
  ◦ One of the two comments must be inside the main function.
  ◦ One of the two comments must be outside the program functions.
  ◦ A second function in addition to the main.
```
```
The second program will have the following properties :

• The executable is named Grace.
• During its execution, the program writes in a file named Grace_kid.c the
  source code of the file used to compile this program.
• The source code must contain at least :
  ◦ No declared main.
  ◦ Three defines.
  ◦ A comment.
• The program will start at the call of a macro.
```
```
The third program will have the following properties :

• The executable is named Sully.
• During its execution, the program writes in a file named Sully_X.c. The X will
  be an integer given in the source. Once the file created, the program compile
  this file then executes the new program (which will be named after its source file).
• The end of the program is determined by the name of the file : if the value of the
  integer X is 0, the resulting program is not executed.
• An integer is then present in the source of your program and must be decremented
  at each source file creation from the program execution.
• You don't have any constraints for the program source code, except for the integer
  which will be set to 5 at first.
```
##### Constraints:
```
• You must write in C and at the norm, and have a Makefile (with the usual rules).
