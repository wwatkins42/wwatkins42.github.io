##### Introduction:
```
The 15-puzzle (also called Gem Puzzle, Boss Puzzle, Game of Fifteen, Mystic Square and many
others) is a sliding puzzle that consists of a frame of numbered square tiles in random
order with one tile missing. The puzzle also exists in other sizes, particularly the smaller
8-puzzle. If the size is 3×3 tiles, the puzzle is called the 8-puzzle or 9-puzzle, and if
4×4 tiles, the puzzle is called the 15-puzzle or 16-puzzle named, respectively, for the
number of tiles and the number of spaces. The object of the puzzle is to place the tiles in
order by making sliding moves that use the empty space.

##### Objectives:
```
The goal of this project is to solve the N-puzzle ("taquin" in French) game using the A*
search algorithm or one of its variants.
You start with a square board made up of N*N cells. One of these cells will be empty,
the others will contain numbers, starting from 1, that will be unique in this instance of
the puzzle.

Your search algorithm will have to find a valid sequence of moves in order to reach the
final state, a.k.a the "snail solution", which depends on the size of the puzzle.
While there will be no direct evaluation of its performance in this instance of the
project, it has to have at least a vaguely reasonable perfomance : Taking a few second to
solve a 3-puzzle is pushing it, ten seconds is unacceptable.

The only move one can do in the N-puzzle is to swap the empty cell with one of its
neighbors (No diagonals, of course. Imagine you’re sliding a block with a number on it
towards an empty space).
```
##### Constraints:
```
Implement the A* search algorithm (or one of its variants, you’re free to choose) to solve
an N-puzzle, with the following constraints:
• You have to manage various puzzle sizes (3, 4, 5, 17, etc ...). The higher your
  program can go without dying a horrible, horrible death, the better.
• You have to manage both randomly determined states (of your own generation of
  course), or input files that specify a starting board, the format of which is described
  in the appendix.
• The cost associated with each transition is always 1.
• The user must be able to choose between at LEAST 3 (relevant) heuristic functions.
  The Manhattan-distance heuristic is mandatory, the other two are up to you. By
  "relevant" we mean they must be admissible (Read up on what this means) and
  they must be something other than "just return a random value".
• At the end of the search, the program has to provide the following values:
  ◦ Total number of states ever selected in the "opened" set (complexity in time).
  ◦ Maximum number of states ever represented in memory at the same time
    during the search (complexity in size).
  ◦ Number of moves required to transition from the initial state to the final state,
    according to the search.
  ◦ The ordered sequence of states that make up the solution, according to the
    search.
  ◦ The puzzle may be unsolvable, in which case you have to inform the user and
    exit.

__Installation:__

* `git clone https://github.com/wwatkins42/N-Puzzle.git`
* `cd ./N-Puzzle`
* `make`
* `./npuzzle`

**Usage:**
* `./npuzzle [<(npuzzle-gen.py [-u] [-s] [-i iterations] size)]`

**Options:**
* `-s`, `--solvable` ensures that the generated puzzle is solvable.
* `-u`, `--unsolvable` ensures that the generated puzzle is unsolvable.
* `-i`, `--iterations` sets the number of iterations for the random puzzle generation.

**Example:**
* `./npuzzle <(npuzzle-gen.py -s -i 4096 5)`
Will solve a `solvable` puzzle generated with `4096 iterations` of size `5*5`.
