_This project is about sorting a list composed of integer values while being restricted in the possibles moves._

__Installation:__

* `git clone https://github.com/wwatkins42/42_C_Projects.git`
* `cd ./42_C_Projects/Push_swap`
* `make`
* `./push_swap 4 2 5 1 8`

**Usage:**
* `./push_swap integer list`

__Rules:__
* The game is constituted of two piles named `a` and `b`.
* At the beginning, `b` is empty and `a` contains a certain number of integers positives or negatives (without duplicates).
* The goal is to sort `a` in an increasing way.
* To this end we dispose of the following operations:
  * (`sa`) swap `a` - Swap the first two elements of `a`.
  * (`sb`) swap `b` - Swap the first two elements of `b`.
  * (`ss`) `sa` and `sb` at the same time.
  * (`pa`) push `a` - Take the first element from top of `b` and put it on `a`.
  * (`pb`) push `b` - Take the first element from top of `a` and put it on `b`.
  * (`ra`) rotate `a` - Shift of a position all elements of `a` (towards the top, the first element becomes the last).
  * (`rb`) rotate `b` - Shift of a position all elements of `b` (towards the top, the first element becomes the last).
  * (`rr`) `ra` and `rb` at the same time.
  * (`rra`) reverse rotate `a` (towards the bottom, the last element becomes the first).
  * (`rrb`) reverse rotate `b` (towards the bottom, the last element becomes the first).
  * (`rrr`) `rra` and `rrb` at the same time.
