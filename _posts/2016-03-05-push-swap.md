##### Introduction:
```
The Push_swap project is a very simple and highly effective algorithm project: data will
need to be sorted. You have at your disposal a set of int values, 2 stacks and a set of
instructions to manipulate both stacks.
```
##### Objectives:
```
To write a sorting algorithm is always a very important step in a coder’s life, because it
is often the first encounter with the concept of complexity.
Sorting algorithms, and their complexities are part of the classic questions discussed
during job interviews. It’s probably a good time to look at these concepts because you’ll
have to face them at one point.

The learning objectives of this project are rigor, use of C and use of basic algorithms.
Especially looking at the complexity of these basic algorithms.
Sorting values is simple. To sort them the fastest way possible is less simple, especially
because from one integers configuration to another, the most efficient sorting algorithm
can differ.
```
##### Constraints:
```
Within your mandatory part you are allowed to use the following functions:
◦ write
◦ read
◦ malloc
◦ free
◦ exit
```

__Installation:__

* `git clone https://github.com/wwatkins42/42_C_Projects.git`
* `cd ./42_C_Projects/Push_swap`
* `make`
* `./push_swap 4 2 5 1 8`

**Usage:**
* `./push_swap integer list`

__Rules:__
* The game is constituted of two piles named `a` and `b`.
* At the beginning, `b` is empty and `a` contains a certain number of integers positives or negatives (without duplicates).
* The goal is to sort `a` in an increasing way.
* To this end we dispose of the following operations:
  * (`sa`) swap `a` - Swap the first two elements of `a`.
  * (`sb`) swap `b` - Swap the first two elements of `b`.
  * (`ss`) `sa` and `sb` at the same time.
  * (`pa`) push `a` - Take the first element from top of `b` and put it on `a`.
  * (`pb`) push `b` - Take the first element from top of `a` and put it on `b`.
  * (`ra`) rotate `a` - Shift of a position all elements of `a` (towards the top, the first element becomes the last).
  * (`rb`) rotate `b` - Shift of a position all elements of `b` (towards the top, the first element becomes the last).
  * (`rr`) `ra` and `rb` at the same time.
  * (`rra`) reverse rotate `a` (towards the bottom, the last element becomes the first).
  * (`rrb`) reverse rotate `b` (towards the bottom, the last element becomes the first).
  * (`rrr`) `rra` and `rrb` at the same time.
