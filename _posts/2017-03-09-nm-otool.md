##### Introduction:
```
The nm command ships with a number of later versions of Unix and similar operating systems.
nm is used to examine binary files (including libraries, compiled object modules,
shared-object files, and standalone executables) and to display the contents of those files,
or meta information stored in them, specifically the symbol table. The output from nm
distinguishes between various symbol types. For example, it differentiates between a
function that is supplied by an object module and a function that is required by it.

nm is used as an aid for debugging, to help resolve problems arising from name conflicts
and C++ name mangling, and to validate other parts of the toolchain.

##### Objectives:
```
You must recode the nm command (without options) and the otool command

Within the mandatory part, you are allowed to use only the following functions:
◦ open
◦ close
◦ mmap
◦ munmap
◦ write
◦ fstat
◦ malloc
◦ free
