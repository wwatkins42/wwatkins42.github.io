##### Introduction:
```
Don’t let Wolfenstein 3D’s basic graphics and violent gameplay fool you! It is in fact a
highly complex and advanced game. There is a reason why John Carmack is considered
one of the world’s best coders.

In this project you must follow in the footsteps of this brillant programmer and write
your own version of Wolfenstein 3D... Hold on, we won’t ask you to re-write not the
ENTIRE Wolfenstein 3D. One has to be be realistic here. Your mission will be to write,
using the ray casting technique, a 3D representation of a maze in which a player can find
his/her way.
```
##### Objectives:
```
This project’s objectives are similar to all this first year’s objectives: Rigor, use of C,
use of basic algorithms, information research, data mining etc.
As a graphic design project, Wolf3D will enable you to solidify your skills in this area:
windows, colors, events, fill shapes etc.
```
##### Constraints:
```
You must create a 3D graphically “realistic” representation that we could have from
inside a maze in a subjective view. You need to create this representation using the
Ray-Casting principles mentioned earlier.
• You can choose the size and the shape of your labyrinth.
• The management of your window must remain smooth: passing over of another
  window, minimization, etc.
• Pressing ESC must close the window and quit the program cleanly.
• Clicking on the red cross on the window’s frame must close the window and quit
  the program cleanly.
• The arrows on the keyboard must allow you to move in real time in the maze, like
  in the original game.
• The wall’s colors must vary depending on the direction (North, South, East, West).
  The implementation of some bonuses in this project can supersede this rule (wall
  textures for example.)

Within the mandatory part, you are allowed to use only the following libc functions:
◦ open
◦ read
◦ write
◦ close
◦ malloc
◦ free
◦ perror
◦ strerror
◦ exit
◦ All functions of the math library (-lm man man 3 math)
◦ All functions of the MinilibX or their equivalent in another graphic library.

__Installation:__

* `git clone https://github.com/wwatkins42/42_C_Projects.git`
* `cd ./42_C_Projects/Wolf3d`
* `make`
* `./wolf3d`

**Usage:**
* `./wolf3d [-m file_path] [-t file_path] [-w width] [-h height] [--help]`

**Options:**
* `-m` [`file_path`]      loads map from file_path.
* `-t` [`file_path`]      loads textures pack from file_path.
* `-w` [`window_width`] loads with defined window width.
* `-h` [`window_height`]  loads with defined window height.
* `--help`  display help text.

**Example:**
* `./wolf3d -m resource/map/labyrinth.map -t resource/template/pack_3.template -w 1000 -h 640`

**Keys:**
* &#8593; &#8592; &#8595; &#8594; or `w` `a` `s` `d`: move around.
* `q`, `e` or `mouse`: rotate view
* `m`: *change mouse rotation*
