_This project consist of creating a realistic graphical representation of what we could see inside of a labyrinth._
_The representation is realised using the raycasting technique._

__Subject:__
##### Objectives:
```
This project’s objectives are similar to all this first year’s objectives: Rigor, use of C, use
of basic algorithms, information research, data mining etc.
As a graphic design project, Wolf3D will enable you to solidify your skills in this area:
windows, colors, events, fill shapes etc.
```
```
To conclude Wolf3D is a remarkable playground to explore the playful practical applications
of mathematics without having to understand the specifics. John Carmack is
undoubtedly a genius. He was one of the first programmers to think about these applications
and remains famous for them today. With the help of the numerous documents
available on the internet, you will use mathematics as a tool to create elegant and efficient
algorithms.
```
```
Imagine yourself in 1991. You are working for a SME in Mesquite TX; you love to
watch gory movies and listen to Heavy Metal music; GPU and hardware acceleration do
not yet exist; and you will become a Video-Game Rock Star in less than 2 years. In two
words, HAVE FUN!
```
##### Constraints:
```
You must create a 3D graphically “realistic” representation that we could have from
inside a maze in a subjective view. You need to create this representation using the
Ray-Casting principles mentioned earlier.
• You can choose the size and the shape of your labyrinth.
• The management of your window must remain smooth: passing over of another
  window, minimization, etc.
• Pressing ESC must close the window and quit the program cleanly.
• Clicking on the red cross on the window’s frame must close the window and quit
  the program cleanly.
• The arrows on the keyboard must allow you to move in real time in the maze, like
  in the original game.
• The wall’s colors must vary depending on the direction (North, South, East, West).
  The implementation of some bonuses in this project can supersede this rule (wall
  textures for example.)
```
```
Within the mandatory part, you are allowed to use only the following libc functions:
◦ open
◦ read
◦ write
◦ close
◦ malloc
◦ free
◦ perror
◦ strerror
◦ exit
◦ All functions of the math library (-lm man man 3 math)
◦ All functions of the MinilibX or their equivalent in another graphic library.

__Installation:__

* `git clone https://github.com/wwatkins42/42_C_Projects.git`
* `cd ./42_C_Projects/Wolf3d`
* `make`
* `./wolf3d`

**Usage:**
* `./wolf3d [-m file_path] [-t file_path] [-w width] [-h height] [--help]`

**Options:**
* `-m` [`file_path`]      loads map from file_path.
* `-t` [`file_path`]      loads textures pack from file_path.
* `-w` [`window_width`] loads with defined window width.
* `-h` [`window_height`]  loads with defined window height.
* `--help`  display help text.

**Example:**
* `./wolf3d -m resource/map/labyrinth.map -t resource/template/pack_3.template -w 1000 -h 640`

**Keys:**
* &#8593; &#8592; &#8595; &#8594; or `w` `a` `s` `d`: move around.
* `q`, `e` or `mouse`: rotate view
* `m`: *change mouse rotation*
