__Subject:__
##### Objectives:
```
This small project is about writing a library to handle dynamical memory allocation.
In order to be able to make it use by already existing programs without modifying or
recompiling them, you should rewrite malloc(3), free(3) and realloc(3) of the libc.

Your functions will be prototyped like those implemented on the system:

#include <stdlib.h>
void free(void *ptr);
void *malloc(size_t size);
void *realloc(void *ptr, size_t size);

• The malloc() function allocate “size” octets of memory and returns a pointer on
  the allocated memory.
• The realloc() function try to modify the size of the allocation pointed by “ptr”
  to “size” octets, and returns “ptr”. If there is not enough room at this memory
  location pointed by “ptr”, realloc() creates a new allocation and returns a
  pointer on this new allocation.
• The free() function frees the memory allocation pointed by “ptr”. If “ptr” is
  NULL, free() does nothing.
• If an error occurs, the malloc() and realloc() functions return a NULL pointer.
• You must use the syscall mmap(2) and munmap(2) to claim and return memory to the
  system.
• You must handle your own memory allocations for the internal workings of your
  project, without using the libc malloc function.
• You must limit the numbers of call to mmap() in order to have better performances,
  but also to munmap(). You must then “pre-allocate” memory areas to store “TINY”
  and “SMALL” malloc.
• The size of those areas must be a multiple of getpagesize().
• Each area must contain at least 100 allocations.
  ◦ The “TINY” mallocs, from 1 to n octets, will be stored in area of size N octets.
  ◦ The “SMALL” mallocs, from (n+1) to m octets, will be stored in area of size M octets.
  ◦ The “LARGE” mallocs, from (m+1) and more, will be stored outside areas, simply with a
    mmap(), they are sort of an area to themselves.
• It's up to you to chose the sizes n, m, N and M in order to find a good compromise
  between speed (less system calls) and memory usage.
```
##### Constraints:
```
Within the mandatory part, you are allowed to use only the following functions:
◦ mmap(2)
◦ munmap(2)
◦ getpagesize(3)
◦ getrlimit(2)
◦ All functions allowed for your libft (write(2) for example).
◦ All functions of the libpthread.
```

__Installation:__

* `git clone https://github.com/wwatkins42/42_C_Projects.git`
* `cd ./42_C_Projects/Malloc`
* `make`
* `./test/run.sh ./[file]`

**Usage:**
* `./test/run.sh ./[file]`
* `run.sh is a script used to inject my malloc library to use in executables instead of the default implementation of malloc.`

**Example:**
* `gcc ./test/test1 -o test1`
* `./test/run.sh /usr/bin/time -l ./test1`
