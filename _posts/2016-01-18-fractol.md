##### Objectives:
```
This project is to create a small fractal exploration program. Start by seeing what a
fractal is.
```
##### Contraints:
```
• Your software should offer at least 3 different types of fractals, from which at least
  the Julia set and the Mandelbrot set (a third fractal is your choice).
• It must be possible to vary the mouse (without clicking) the parameter of the Julia
  set. The other types of fractal, it is left to your option.
• The mouse wheel zooms in and out on the current mouse position, and this in a
  quasi infinite way (modulo the limits of the machine). This is the same principle of
  fractals.
• There must be a minimum play of color to feel the depth of each fractal. Better
  hack away on psychedelic effects.
• A parameter is passed on the command line to define what type of fractal is to
  view. If there is no parameter provided, or if the parameter is invalid, the program
  displays a list of available parameters and exits.

• You must use the minilibX, in its version for XQuartz installed by default on the
  dump, or in its native version for MacOS X.
• You have to manage properly the expose.
• ESC will exit the program.
• The use of images of the minilibX is strongly recommended.

__Installation:__

* `git clone https://github.com/wwatkins42/42_C_Projects.git`
* `cd ./42_C_Projects/Fractol`
* `make`
* `./fractol [type]`

**Usage:**
* `./fractol [type] [-w width] [-h height] [--help]`
* type: 
  * `julia`
  * `mandelbrot`
  * `burningship`
  * `tricorn`

**Options:**
* `-w` [`window_width`] loads with defined window width.
* `-h` [`window_height`]  loads with defined window height.
* `--help`  display help text.

**Example:**
* `./fractol burningship -w 640 -h 640`

**Keys:**
* `+` `-` or `mouse wheel`: zoom on mouse position
* `mouse`: change julia settings
* `o`: switch background color
* `p`: change color palette
* &#8670; &#8671;: change number of iteration
